Roost is an open-source adaptive thermostat.

Similar to the [Nest](http://www.nest.com/) thermostat, Roost adapts to your habits and figures out an optimal schedule for heat, A/C, and humidity controls.

Unlike the Nest, Roost is built around open standards and easy data access. Roost does not rely on any external services. It provides an API for data access and control and can be assembled from open-source software and hardware for under $200.

# Availability

Roost is currently under development. No stable releases are currently available.

# Hardware

Roost uses a Raspberry Pi Model B as a base station, and talks to environmental sensors using a mesh radio network, so there are no wires to run through your walls. A complete parts lists (with vendors) [will be available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ann48md_Q6mkdGxOWUYwYnFqajRUcWVmSHZIcS0xV3c#gid=0).

# Software

Roost will provide simple APIs, making integration with other devices and software easy.
