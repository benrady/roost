OpenEnv is an open-source adaptive thermostat.

Similar to the [Nest](http://www.nest.com/) thermostat, OpenEnv adapts to your habits and figures out an optimal schedule for heat, A/C, and humidity controls.

Unlike the Nest, OpenEnv is built around open standards and easy data access and caters to the DIY-er. OpenEnv does not rely on any external services, provides an API for data access and control, and can be assembled from open-source hardware and software for under $200.

# Hardware

OpenEnv uses a Raspberry Pi Model B as a base station, and talks to environmental sensors using a mesh radio network. Complete parts lists (with vendors) and schematics are available in the wiki.

# Software

OpenEnv APIs, making integration with other devices and software easy.
