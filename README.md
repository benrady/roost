HomeSense is an open-source adaptive thermostat.

Similar to the [Nest](http://www.nest.com/) thermostat, HomeSense adapts to your habits and figures out an optimal schedule for heat, A/C, and humidity controls.

Unlike the Nest, HomeSense is built around open standards and easy data access. HomeSense does not rely on any external services, provides an API for data access and control, and can be assembled from open-source hardware and software for under $200.

# Hardware

HomeSense uses a Raspberry Pi Model B as a base station, and talks to environmental sensors using an XBee mesh radio network. Complete parts lists (with vendors) and schematics are available in the wiki.

# Software

HomeSense APIs, making integration easy for the DIY-er.

## HTTP API

## Real-Time (WebSocket) API
