Description: An open source adaptive home thermostat 
 Similar to the Nest thermostat, HomeSense adapts to your habits to determine optimal schedules for heat, A/C and humidity controls. 
 Unlike the Nest, HomeSense is built around open hardware, open software, and open data. HomeSense does not rely on any external services, provides an API for data access and can be assembled for under $200
