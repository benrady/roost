Description: Open source adaptive home thermostat 
 Similar to the Nest thermostat, OpenEnv adapts 
 to your habits to determine optimal schedules 
 for heat, A/C and humidity controls. 
 
 Unlike the Nest, OpenEnv is built around open 
 hardware, open software, and open data. 
 OpenEnv does not rely on any external services, 
 provides an API for data access and can be 
 assembled for under $200
